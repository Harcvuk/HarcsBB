He'd wear the mask and act like Meran, as that was the attitude he had planned for the character. This was pretty popular in MobiTown. But one day, there was some sort of curse that hit Merlin in the middle of a play, which caused his spirit to enter the mask. Then the mask had risen, gained some shadows around it, then it came to life. as soon as the mask figured out what was happening, it started its evil things. it was soon revealed during an evil scream that the mask was Meran. Meran had came to life by a curse, with Merlin seemingly gone out of nowhere. People had suspected that Merlin is stuck in this mask.\n\n",

Unlike his flamboyant and loud brother, Sans is laid-back and pretty lazy. One day, a human child named Frisk showed up in the Underground. When they entered Snowdin for the first time, Sans was there to meet them. Sans told them about Papyrus, who hoped to capture a human to become a member of the Underground's Royal Guard, and asked if Frisk would show themself to Papyrus just to make him happy to see a human. Frisk agreed, and while Papyrus didn't capture them, Frisk befriended the skeleton brothers. However, Sans still hides several secrets and a large amount of power underneath his laziness, being the one who killed the sentient flower Flowey more times than any monster.",

                "powers/abilities": "Bones: One of Sans' and Papyrus' signature ability is to summon bones to attack their opponent. While Papyrus' were usually easy to dodge, Sans can summon large groups of them easily and with great speed, making them harder to predict and dodge by comparison. Sans can also summon blue bones that only damage people if they're moving when they touch the bones.\n\nSoul Manipulation: Blue Mode: Another of the skeleton brothers' signature attack, Blue Mode grants Sans the ability to make enemy souls affected by gravity. While affected by Blue Mode, enemies have their movement heavily restricted, and are only able to jump to move. Sans can also use this to telekinetically lift and move his opponent, letting him slam them around with his mind.\n\nKarma: A side effect of Sans' attacks, Karmic Retribution acts as poison for the soul, whittling down an enemy's health once Sans hits them. While it only drains a little at a time, it's drain increases based on how many sins the opponent has committed.\nTeleportation: Somehow, Sans obtained the ability to teleport, which he often uses as a shortcut to get places quicker. However, in battle, Sans uses it to move his foe straight into a new attack once his old one ends, making him far more unpredictable.",
